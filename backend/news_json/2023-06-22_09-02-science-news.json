The study found that the apple maggot fly, a major agricultural pest, began to diverge into two populations in the Hudson Valley in the 1850s, with one population shifting to a new food source: apple trees. The study found that the two fly populations responded to temperature shifts in starkly different ways, with the hawthorn-dwellers appearing to have more resilience.
