The increased heart rate can cause a stroke in some cases. The researchers used a specialized computational model to simulate blood flow in the carotid arteries in three stages of stenosis, without obstruction, with mild obstruction of 30%, and with moderate obstruction of 50%. They compared the effect of exercise-induced heart rate of 140 beats per minute with resting heart rates of 67 and 100 beats per minute. Exercise improved the health of the simulated carotid artery for healthy and mild cases, but the results for moderate stenosis were concerning.
