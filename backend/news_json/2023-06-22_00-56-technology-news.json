Only a few crewed vessels can reach such depths, with the best hope being unmanned underwater drones. The US Navy has a submersible rescue vehicle that can reach a depth of around 600 meters, but it is unlikely to be able to rescue the crew of the Titan. The time factor is also a problem, as the wreck of the Titanic is approximately 600 kilometers from the Canadian coast, and ships that can carry a CURV-21 type vehicle do not move faster than about 30 kilometers per hour.", "url": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3Zpbmt5LmN6L2NsYW5lay96YWhyYW5pY25pLWFtZXJpa2EtemFjaHJhbmEtcG9ub3JreS10aXRhbi16ZS1kbmEtbmVqdmV0c2ktbmFkZWppLW11emUtYnl0LWRyb24tcHJvYmxlbXUtamUtYWxlLXJhZGEtNDA0MzUzMjDSAQA?oc=5", "urlToImage": "https://d39-a.sdn.cz/d_39/c_static_gS_L/WQgg/novinky-logo.svg", "publishedAt": "2023-06-20T20:25:08Z", "content": null}, {"source": {"id": "ign", "name": "IGN"}, "author": "Kat Bailey", "title": "EA Sports and EA Games Splitting Apart in Internal Shakeup - IGN", "description": "EA announced that EA Games will be renamed EA Entertainment in a move that splits it and EA Sports into two separate organizations encompassing many of EA's major studios.", "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-and-ea-games-splitting-apart-in-internal-shakeup", "urlToImage": "https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/06/20/ea-blogroll-logos-1687291298897.jpg?width=1280", "publishedAt": "2023-06-20T20:11:56Z", "content": "Electronic Arts is undergoing a major internal shakeup, announcing today in a message from CEO Andrew Wilson that it is realigning its major studios and its leadership structure in an effort to \"empo\u2026 [+3894 chars]"}, {"source": {"id": "ign", "name": "IGN"}, "author": "Adam Bankhurst", "title": "Nintendo Direct June 2023: How to Watch and What to Expect - IGN", "description": "Nintendo has announced that a brand-new, roughly 40-minute Nintendo Direct will be arriving on June 21 and this guide will provide you with everything you need to know.", "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-june-2023-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect", "urlToImage": "https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/06/20/pik-1687279644842.png?width=1280", "publishedAt": "2023-06-20T20:00:31Z", "content": "The last few weeks have been filled to the brim with exciting summer gaming showcases, and now Nintendo has thrown its Mario-shaped hat into the ring as it has announced a brand-new Nintendo Direct w\u2026 [+4082 chars]"}, {"source": {"id": "google-news", "name": "Google News"}, "author": "Edital Concursos Brasil", "title": "Keep an eye on the FINE!

Using Doppler Effect technology, the new radars can identify these drivers at a considerable distance after the equipment. Unlike conventional radars that measure vehicle speed through sensors on the asphalt, the new radars use electromagnetic waves to capture bad drivers. These radars can measure vehicle speed up to 50 meters after passing the installation point and can also record images that prove prohibited lane changes and red light violations. S\u00e3o Paulo and Curitiba are already using these new radars, and they may be installed in other cities in the future.
